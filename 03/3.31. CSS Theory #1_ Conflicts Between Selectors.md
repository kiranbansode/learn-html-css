It does not matter which class is defined where in elements attributes. Whatever come later in CSS styles file will be applied

```html
<p class="first second">Paragraph</p>
```

```css
/* This will not get applied */
.second {
	color: yellow;
}

/* This will get applied */
.first {
	color: red;
}
```
