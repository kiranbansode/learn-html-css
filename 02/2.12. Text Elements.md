# Text Elements

1. Heading Elements `<h1>` --- `<h6>`

   The `<h1>` to `<h6>` HTML elements represent six levels of section headings. `<h1>` is the highest section level and `<h6>` is the lowest.

   ```html
   <h1>Heading 1</h1>
   <h2>Heading 2</h2>
   <h3>Heading 3</h3>
   <h4>Heading 4</h4>
   <h5>Heading 5</h5>
   <h6>Heading 6</h6>
   ```

2. Paragraph Element `<p>` --- `</p>`

   The `<p>` HTML element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.

   ```html
   <p>This is a paragraph</p>
   ```

3. Strong Element `<strong>` --- `</strong>`

   The \<strong> HTML element indicates that its contents have strong importance, seriousness, or urgency. Browsers typically render the contents in bold type.

   ```html
   <strong>This text is Bold</strong>
   ```

   > Alternatively you can use `<b>` tags to achieve same result, but screen readers will behave differently so it is deprecated. It is strongly recommended to use `<strong>` tag

4. Emphasis element `<em>` --- `</em>`

   The `<em>` HTML element marks text that has stress emphasis. The `<em>` element can be nested, with each level of nesting indicating a greater degree of emphasis. Typically `<em>` element is displayed in italic type

   ```html
   <em>This text is emphasised </em>
   ```
