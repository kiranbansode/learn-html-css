# Class and ID Selectors

## ID Selectors

The CSS ID selector matches an element based on the value of the element's `id` attribute. In order for the element to be selected, its id attribute must match exactly the value given in the selector.

```html
<p id="author">
	Posted by <strong>Laura Jones</strong> on the Monday, June 21st 2027
</p>
```

To select an element with a specific id using CSS, write a hash (`#`) character, followed by the id of the element.

```css
#author {
	font-style: italic;
	font-size: 18px;
}
```

## Class selectors

The CSS class selector matches elements based on the contents of their `class` attribute.

```html
<p class="related-author">By Jim Dillon</p>
```

To select elements with a specific class using CSS, write a period (`.`) character, followed by the class name.

```css
.related-author {
	font-size: 18px;
	font-weight: bold;
}
```
