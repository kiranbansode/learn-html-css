# Combining Selectors

## Selector List [Grouping Selector] : `h1, h2`

The CSS selector list (,) selects all the matching nodes.
The grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style definitions.

```css
h1,
h2,
h3,
h4,
p,
li {
	font-family: sans-serif;
}
```

## Descendant Combinator : `h1 h2`

Typically represented by a single space (`" "`) character â€” combines two selectors such that elements matched by the second selector are selected if they have an ancestor (parent, parent's parent, parent's parent's parent, etc.) element matching the first selector.

```css
article header p {
	font-style: italic;
}
```
