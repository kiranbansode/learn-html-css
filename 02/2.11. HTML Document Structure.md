# HTML Document Structure

- Every HTMl file needs to start with so called `DOCTYPE` tag, this will tell browser that we are using HTML 5 specifications.
- After DOCTYPE there should be 1 `html` tag.
- Inside html tag there should 1 `head` and 1 `body` tag.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head></head>
	<body></body>
</html>
```
