# Watch Before You Start!

1. You can do it, We know you can
2. You really have to write code `YOURSELF`
3. If you want the course material to stick, `take notes`.
4. Don't beat yourself up if you can't figure it out!
5. Before moving on from a section, make sure that you understand exactly what was covered.
6. Start by trying to solve it yourself! This is essential for your progress.
7. Most importantly, `have fun!`
