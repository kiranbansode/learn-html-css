# CSS Theory #2 Inheritance and the Universal Selector

## Inheritance

In CSS, inheritance controls what happens when no value is specified for a property on an element.

CSS properties can be categorized in two types:

- inherited properties, which by default are set to the computed value of the parent element
- non-inherited properties, which by default are set to initial value of the property

## Universal Selector `*`

The `*` selector selects all elements.

```css
* {
	color: black;
}
```
