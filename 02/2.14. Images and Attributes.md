# Images and Attributes

## Image Element `<img />`

The `<img>` HTML element embeds an image into the document.

```html
<img
	class="fit-picture"
	src="https://interactive-examples.mdn.mozilla.net/media/cc0-images/grapefruit-slice-332-332.jpg"
	alt="Grapefruit slice atop a pile of other slices"
/>
```

The _`src`_ attribute is required, and contains the path to the image you want to embed.

> attributes; these are additional values that configure the elements or adjust their behavior in various ways to meet the criteria the users want.

The _`alt`_ attribute holds a text description of the image, which isn't mandatory but is incredibly useful for accessibility â€” screen readers read this description out to their users so they know what the image means. Alt text is also displayed on the page if the image can't be loaded for some reason: for example, network errors, content blocking, or linkrot.
