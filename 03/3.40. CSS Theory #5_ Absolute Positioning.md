# CSS Theory #5 Absolute Positioning

## Normal Flow

1. Default positioning
2. Element is `in flow`
3. Elements are simply laid out according to their order in the HTML code

Default positioning
`position: relative`

## Absolute Positioning

1. Element is removed from the normal flow: `out of flow`
2. No impact on surrounding elements, might overlap them
3. We use top, bottom, left or right to offset the element from its `relatively positioned container`

`position: absolute`
