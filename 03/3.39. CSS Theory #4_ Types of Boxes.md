# CSS Theory #4 Types of Boxes

## BLOCK-Level Elements

1. Elements are formatted visually as `blocks`
2. Elements occupy `100% of parent elements width`, no matter the content.
3. Elements are `stacked vertically` by default, one after another
4. The box-model applied as showed earlier

Default elements : `body`, `main`, `header`, `footer`, `section`, `nav`, `aside`, `div`, `h1-h6`, `p`, `ul`, `ol`, `li`, etc.

With CSS: `display: block`

## INLINE-Level Elements

1. Occupies only the space `necessary for its content`
2. Causes `no line-breaks` after or before the element
3. Box model applies in a different way: `heights and widths do not apply`
4. `Paddings and margins` are applied only `horizontally (left and right)`

Default: `a`, `img`, `strong`, `em`, `button`, etc.

With CSS: `display: inline`

## INLINE-BLOCK Level Elements

1. Looks like inline from the `outside`, behaves like block-level on the `inside`
2. Occupies only content's space
3. Causes no line-breaks
4. Box-model applies as showed

With CSS: `display: inline-block`
